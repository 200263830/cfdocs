# Contributor Guide for CFDocs

### Should I use tabs or spaces?

Tabs.

### For boolean values should I use `yes`/`no` or `true`/`false`

Use `true`/`false`

### Where can I find documentation about the JSON file format used?

The main README has that documented: https://github.com/foundeo/cfdocs#json-file-documentation

### What version of CF should the cfdocs CFML code work on?

It should run on Adobe ColdFusion 10+ or Lucee 4.5+ please make sure any changes 
made to the codebase work on these platforms. Sadly that means you can't use member
functions at this time.
